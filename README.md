Txt parser
So this is little console project. Projects will open text file and parse it into objects and then serialize it into json and save it on json file.
Inside project you will see 2 paths (txtFile and jsonFile) where you need to enter your path to your files.
Exmaple of txt file:
Type;OIB;Name;Gender;DateOfBirth;AvgGrade;Paycheck
Student;001212;Fani Tafra;Female;1998/02/02;4.3;
Professor;001213;Duje Miljevic;Male;1961/01/01;;100.00
